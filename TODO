## Future Releases

- Convert the `@molecularProfiles` slot to be a `MultiAssayExperiment` object
instead of a `list`
- Reimplement `PharmacoSet` set operations (intersect, subset, etc.) using
generics defined in the `BiocGenerics` package
- Redesign the `@sensitivity` and `@perturbation` slots to use either existing
Bioconductor classes or custom implementations of Bioconductor classes
- Add support for drug combinations to the package
- Add support for new types of molecular data such as metabolomics, proteomics,
and single cell sequencing
- Continue to abstract functionality into CoreGx
