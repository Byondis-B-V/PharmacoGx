\arguments{
\item{dose_to}{\code{numeric} a vector of concentrations of the drug being added to}

\item{viability}{\code{numeric} Observed viability of two treatments; target for fitting curve.}

\item{dose_add}{\code{numeric} a vector of concentrations of the drug added.}

\item{EC50_add}{\code{numeric} relative EC50 of the drug added.}

\item{HS_add}{\code{numeric} Hill coefficient of the drug added.}

\item{use_L2}{\code{logical} Whether to use L2 loss for fitting curves.
This method produces cruder estimates for projected Hill parameters of
drug combinations difficult to optimise, but also faster to compute results.
Use it only if the default method is not progressing. Default \code{FALSE}.}

\description{
Estimate the projected potency EC50 and the shape parameter HS
in the dose-response curve of a drug after adding another drug to it
by fitting a 2-parameter dose-response curve.
It assumes \eqn{E_min = 1} for the drug being added and
\eqn{E_inf = 0} for both drugs.
